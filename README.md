# Scala Web App

I've been learning Scala to better understand what functional programming is.
I completed several courses:

1. [Functional Programming in Scala Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala)
2. [Scala Cats](https://rockthejvm.com/p/cats)
3. [Scala Cats Effect](https://rockthejvm.com/p/cats-effect)

Therefore, I decided to set up a small web app project to round up what I've learned.

I created an authentication service that includes the following:

-   JWT based authentication
-   Refresh tokens
-   Sign in, refresh token, get current user, and sign out API endpoints

This repo contains both, the Scala backend and Next.js frontend parts of the app.
Both apps include their readmes with instructions.
