# Scala Web App

I've been learning Scala for a while and decided to set up a small web app
to round up what I learned.

I created an authentication service that includes the following:

-   JWT based authentication
-   Refresh tokens
-   Sign in, refresh token, get current user, and sign out api endpoints

This repo contains both, Scala backend and Next.js frontend parts of the app.
Both apps include their own readmes with instructions.
